Maintaining high customer loyalty is a challenge that most of the businesses face. Multiple studies have shown that retaining customers is more profitable than acquiring new ones.
In Customer Relationship Management (CRM) field, churn prediction is a very active area of research.
Most of the previous studies were conducted in the industries operating in contractual setting, where the churn rate is not that big, for example telecom or banking.

This study is aimed at predicting loyalty of the customers of an e-commerce retail shop operating on the Brazilian market. 
A challenge that to the best of the author's knowledge was not addressed in the previous studies is churn prediction in an industry, in which a very low rate of the customers stay with the company. In the case of this study almost 97% of the customers don't decide to make a second purchase. 
Also, this study is a first approach to predict customer loyalty not using a rich customer's history, but only the first transaction. 
Because of that, usage of non-conventional data sources was needed. 
That is why, in this study besides transaction data about the customer, I also analyze customer's geodemographic environment obtained from census data, as well as information from customer's perception about the purchase in form of textual reviews. 

From a technical point of view, I have used a Machine Learning approach. I have tested out 2 classification algorithms, namely XGBoost and Logistic Regression. To obtain a meaningful information from the text reviews, I have used topic modeling technique. 
To be able to answer hypotheses about the influence of variables on the target in the case of XGBoost modeling, which is an unexplainable, black-box model, I have made extensive use of XAI techniques. To assess the importance of particular sets of features I have used Permutation Variable Importance, while for assessing the strength and direction of the influence - Partial Dependence Profile technique.

The dataset used in this study ...

<!-- - Intro do problemu - co to churn, zalety predykcji -->
<!-- - Main hypothesis - machine learning modeling can be helpful in ranking customers by their propensity to churn -->

<!-- Contributions: -->

<!-- - Use a wide range of predictors from different categories -->
<!-- - Use topic modeling to extract info from text review - first usage in churn prediction ever -->
<!-- - Use geodemographic variables - in previous studies the results were ambiguous whether they improve prediction -->
<!-- - First that extensive usage of XAI tools to explain model's predictions in churn - previous works only variable importance or more basic algorithms like LR -->
<!-- - First time predicting the customer attitude just after first transaction - this can serve as an important competitive edge (TODO:opisać to bardziej) -->
