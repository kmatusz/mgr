Konspekt, co opisaÄ‡:

- Intro do problemu - co to churn, zalety predykcji
- Main hypothesis - machine learning modeling can be helpful in ranking customers by their propensity to churn

Contributions:

- Use a wide range of predictors from different categories
- Use topic modeling to extract info from text review - first usage in churn prediction ever
- Use geodemographic variables - in previous studies the results were ambiguous whether they improve prediction
- First that extensive usage of XAI tools to explain model's predictions in churn - previous works only variable importance or more basic algorithms like LR
