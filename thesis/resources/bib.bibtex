abstract = {Short text clustering has become an increasingly important task with the popularity of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. It is a challenging problem due to its sparse, high-dimensional, and large-volume characteristics. In this paper, we proposed a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model for short text clustering (abbr. to GSDMM). We found that GSDMM can infer the number of clusters automatically with a good balance between the completeness and homogeneity of the clustering results, and is fast to converge. GSDMM can also cope with the sparse and high-dimensional problem of short texts, and can obtain the representative words of each cluster. Our extensive experimental study shows that GSDMM can achieve significantly better performance than three other clustering models.},

Our unsupervised method only requires word embeddings and a POS tagger, and is therefore straightforward to apply to new domains and languages. We introduce Contrastive Attention (CAt), a novel single-head attention mechanism based on an RBF kernel, which gives a considerable boost in performance and makes the model interpretable. Previous work relied on syntactic features and complex neural models. We show that given the simplicity of current benchmark datasets for aspect extraction, such complex models are not needed.

abstract = {This study investigates the value added by incorporating textual data into customer churn prediction (CCP) models. It extends the previous literature by benchmarking convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against current best practices for analyzing textual data in CCP, and, using real life data from a European financial services provider, validates a framework that explains how textual data can be incorporated in a predictive model. First, the results confirm previous research showing that the inclusion of textual data in a CCP model improves its predictive performance. Second, CNNs outperform current best practices for text mining in CCP. Third, textual data are an important source of data for CCP, but unstructured textual data alone cannot create churn prediction models that are competitive with models that use traditional structured data. A calculation of the additional profit obtained from a customer retention campaign through the inclusion of textual information can be used by practitioners directly to help them make more informed decisions on whether to invest in text mining.}

abstract = {Customer relationship management (CRM) enjoys increasing attention as a countermeasure to switching behaviour of customers. Because foregone profits of (partially) defected customers can be significant, an increase of the retention rate can be very profitable. In this paper we focus on the treatment of a company's most behaviourally loyal customers in a non-contractual setting. We build a model in order to predict partial defection by behaviourally loyal clients using three classification techniques: Logistic regression, automatic relevance determination (ARD) Neural Networks and Random Forests. Focusing on partial attrition of high-frequency shoppers who exhibit a regular visit pattern may overcome the problem of unidentifiability of total defection in non-contractual settings. Classification accuracy (PCC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) are used to evaluate classifier performance on a test/hold-out sample. Using real-life data from an FMCG retailer, we show that future partial defection can be successfully predicted, i.e. exceeding the benchmark hurdle of the null model. There are no significant differences in terms of performance among alternative classification techniques. Similar to direct-marketing applications we find that past behavioural variables, more specifically RFM variables (recency, frequency, and monetary value) are the best predictors of partial customer defection. This set of variables complements demographic variables confirming findings by other authors about its importance in predicting churn behaviour. Moreover, additional variables (listed in decreasing order of importance) such as the length of customer relationship, mode of payment, buying behaviour across categories, usage of promotions and brand purchase behaviour are shown to be moderately useful to incorporate in attrition models.}
